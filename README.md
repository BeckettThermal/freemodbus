# freemodbus
BSD licensed MODBUS RTU/ASCII and TCP slave

Forked from cwalter-at/freemodbus to bugfix and add Modbus FILE read/write functions, since the source does not appear to be maintained (no pull-requests actioned).

Currently only single sub-record file read / write requests are implemented.

Also for use as a submodule in other projects - the original has configuration files that should be in the port.
